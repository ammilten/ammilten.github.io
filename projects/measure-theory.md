Why measure theory...

Difference between MT & Bayes...

  $$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$ 
  test

$$P(m|d)$$

$$ P(\mathbf{m}|\mathbf{d}) = \frac{P(\mathbf{d}|\mathbf{m})}{P(\mathbf{d})} P(\mathbf{m})$$

$$ P_\textrm{post} = \frac{P_\textrm{obs}(g(\mathbf{m}))}{P_\textrm{push}(g(\mathbf{m}))} P_\textrm{prior}(\mathbf{m}) $$

^ note that this doesn't seem to render well online...
