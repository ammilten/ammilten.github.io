# Nonstationary Multiple-Point Geostatistical Simulation

Multiple-point geostatistics (MPS) is a branch of geostatistics that tries to reproduce images with certain geological patterns, like sedimentary lenses and sinusoidal channels.

One of the challenges with traditional MPS algorithms is what's called "nonstationarity". In simple terms, it means that the patterns in the training image must be repeatable over the entire image. If there are trends...

At Michigan Tech, I worked with Prof. Snehamoy Chatterjee to develop an algorithm that partitions a nonstationary training image into stationary sub-images, which can be simulated and stitched together.

Blah blah blah...
